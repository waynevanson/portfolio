# Portfolio

Thanks for visiting my technical portfolio.
Over time I will add projects that cover a bunch of technologies.

## Projects

## Interacting with the Portfolio

There will be to ways to interact with the project.

### Browser

As a web developer, the main entrypoint to an application is through the web.

Navigating to https://portfolio.waynevanson.com will eventually serve a list of portfolio projects to navigate to.

### Locally

All projects will be available for usage locally, using docker to set up a deterministic development environment.

The only dependencies are `docker` and `docker-compose`, which means we can run the interactive CLI in docker with:

```sh

```

and you should receive a prompt selecting you to select a project:

```

```
